Some examples to show why your commits matter and how building your branches well can make it easier to review.

## Example A
- [Version 1](https://github.com/matt-savvy/git-communication-example/pull/2)
The first file makes a change, but you have to read past several other files to see the definition of the new function call.

- [Version 2](https://github.com/matt-savvy/git-communication-example/pull/1)
You can step through the commits one at time to follow the changes easier.

## Example B
- [Version 1](https://github.com/matt-savvy/git-communication-example/pull/4)
The diff refactors AND changes code all at once.

- [Version 2](https://github.com/matt-savvy/git-communication-example/pull/3)
The refactor and the functional changes have been split up.
